## *Salutations* 👋
Hi! I'm a developer born in 1998, I currently work with AWS and backend technologies, but I'm studying reverse engineering and security related topics too.

## Programmer Stuff
- 🚀 As you can see I offer some tools and scripts to help people setup clients on both Linux and Windows on Call of Duty custom clients
- 🕹️ Recreated some retro games!
- 🤖 Created a bunch of discord and telegram bots
- 🌐 Created a bunch of static web pages while I was studying frontend related stuff

## Artistic Stuff
In my free time (*usually night time* 🌙) I like doing some simple pixel art animations, programming isn't the only way to express yourself.

[I made a Youtube playlist containing all of them](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt7-rFt-vkg-Rz6yp3cDInXw5yAJ6mS1j)
